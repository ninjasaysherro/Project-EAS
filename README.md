# Project_EAS

4/4/2022
Hi, my name is Ananta. This will be my second project that is written in JavaScript.
The goal of this project is to explore, in-depth, the utilization of JavaScript DOM manipulations as
well as covering previously learned subjects that include previously learned JavaScript subjects such
as functions, booleans, and such. The project will also include HTML and CSS as well.
In the bigger picture, the end result of Project EAS is to create a grid of various sizes that will
allow the user to hover or click on the canvas, and draw or write shapes and such onto the canvas. This is will function similarly to an 'Etch-A-Sketch' hence the abbreviated version 'EAS'.
