# Project_EAS

4/4/2022
Hi, my name is Ananta. This will be my second project that is written in JavaScript.
The goal of this project is to explore, in-depth, the utilization of JavaScript DOM manipulations as
well as covering previously learned subjects that include previously learned JavaScript subjects such
as functions, booleans, and such. The project will also include HTML and CSS as well.
In the bigger picture, the end result of Project EAS is to create a grid of various sizes that will
allow the user to hover or click on the canvas, and draw or write shapes and such onto the canvas. This is will function similarly to an 'Etch-A-Sketch' hence the abbreviated version 'EAS'.

I just finished the project. I hadn't put in as much effort this time around. There were some days where I was just barely motivated to work on this.
It felt like this project was given too soon after the first JS project (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
To top it off I had recently bought a car that seemed like a good deal but turned out to be a lemon. 
I've been running around trying to get the car sorted out and being distracted from the overall project the past couple of weeks and so I haven't worked
much on this. I just wanted to finish this.

It did teach me about CSS Grid and how to use it but I feel like I still need more practice with this. But overall, I'm pretty happy with the JavaScript
portion of this project. I would say it has solidified my understanding of DOM manipulation and event listeners.
